# IceBlockGame
A quick Python game you can play right on the console!

Back when I was first learning Python (in what feels like _eons_ ago), I built this simple game you could run on the console. I know I was directly inspired by similar puzzle mechanics in the video games I was playing at the time.

## How to play
You are an ice block (I), sliding along a slippery surface in hopes of stopping right at your goal (G). You better use the blockades to your advantage!

It starts right on your console. If you download this, go ahead and run the script (`python3 IceBlock.py`). Input is done via WASD keys (hitting enter after each entry).

Yes, the graphics are just that incredible.
